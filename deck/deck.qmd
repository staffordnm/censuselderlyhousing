How are different aging populations affected by housing costs in Central Pines Regional Council’s NC counties of interest?

1. Chatham and Lee
2. Durham
3. Orange
4. Wake 
5. Moore and Montgomery
6. Johnston

## Data Used

- Latitude and Longitude data via tidycensus 
- Census Bureau’s survey’s: ACS 1-Year Estimates Public Use Microdata Sample from 2021 (ACSPUMS1Y2021)

## Weights
PUMS data is a sample of about 1% of the US population. 

When we want to estimate a variable that represents the entire population rather than a sample, we have to apply a weighting adjustment. 

The weight variable tells us the number of people in the population that the observation represents. 

We used the PUMS person weight for all population estimate calculations.

## Variables
|                  |                      |
|------------------|----------------------|
| housing_unit_weight |   tenure    |
| person_weight    | sex                  |
| household_income | american_indian   |
| total_person_income | asian            |
| percent_gross_own | white                |
| property_taxes   | black     |
|  monthly_rent    | pum_code               |
|   age            | state               |
|  percent_gross_rent  | county           |


## Variables Created
1. Rent Burden: if obs rent burdened or not 
2. Owner Burden: if obs housing burdened or not 
3. N_Pop: Total population per county
4. Aging_Rent_Burden: rent burden for indivudals over 55 years old
5. Aging_Owner_Burden: housing burden for indivudals over 55 years old

## Findings
- Rent cost burden and home ownership burden is worse for Black residents of all counties.
- Chatham and Lee counties the percent home owner cost burden is closer making it less of a disparity along race.
- Rent burden is consistently under 10% across all counties for white residents, potentially because they are more likely to own than rent.
- Wake County as the most populous county has the largest number of individuals 55+ with an expected stacking of more younger age groups compared to older age groups.

## Findings
- Rent burden is concentrated around Raleigh in Wake County and Durham in Durham County.
- Percent of population burdened by home owner costs are more evenly distributed across the counties with some hot spots in Durham, Wake, and Johnston Counties.
- Most counties follow an expected pattern of aging populations across different age groups meaning there are more people in younger categories and less people as they age.
