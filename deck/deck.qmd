How are different aging populations affected by housing costs in Central Pines Regional Council’s NC counties of interest?

1. Chatham and Lee
2. Durham
3. Orange
4. Wake 
5. Moore and Montgomery
6. Johnston

## Data Used

- Latitude and Longitude data via tidycensus 
- Census Bureau’s survey’s: ACS 1-Year Estimates Public Use Microdata Sample from 2021 (ACSPUMS1Y2021)

## Weights
PUMS data is a sample of about 1% of the US population. 

When we want to estimate a variable that represents the entire population rather than a sample, we have to apply a weighting adjustment. 

The weight variable tells us the number of people in the population that the observation represents. 

We used the PUMS person weight for all population estimate calculations.

## Variables

## Findings
- Rent cost burden and home ownership burden is worse for Black residents of all seven counties. 
- Rent burden is over-all lower for white residents, likely because they are more likely to own than rent.
- The population of Wake County is significantly larger than the other counties observed and skews younger. 
- Rent burden is concentrated in XX place as compared to home ownership cost burden which is felt throughout Wake and Durham counties.
